## Detection and Tracking of Harbor Porpoises in UAV Recordings - Master Thesis
This project proposes methods for detecting and tracking harbor porpoises in video recordings from conducted flights with a commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The UAV used to carry out these flights and acquire sensor data and video is a DJI Phantom Pro 4. This is achieved by using deep learning to detect the harbor porpoises and Kalman filtering to track them. The objective is to develop a system that can detect and track the harbor porpoises and then convert the tracked location of the harbor porpoises to GPS coordinates and visualize them using Google Earth. The detection of the harbor porpoises is accomplished by introducing a two-stage top-down paradigm where an object detector is first used to detect the bounding boxes that surround the harbor porpoises, then these resized bounding boxes are used as input to the keypoint detector. The keypoint detector detects the keypoints of the head, fin and tail for each individual harbor porpoise. These detections will then be used to track the harbor porpoises through multiple video frames. The keypoint for the head of the tracked harbor porpoises will then be used to estimate the GPS location of each individual harbor porpoise to map their path Google Earth.
